FEATURES
ADD, REMOVE, UPDATE CAMPGROUND
  The ultimate goal of the app is to add campgrounds, be they real or fictitious, Iâ€™m not much of a camper myself so I usually add fictional ones like for example, I made a campground called Lake Hylia Lodge, which is a reference to the Zelda series, however if you want to add real campground information feel free to, I actually implore anyone that visits the site to put up one of their favorite camping sports.
  
User Authentication
  You can sign up, sign in, and its a necessary process to go through if you want to contribute to the site, why? because when a user is signed in it allows them to add campgrounds and comments, to really add a sense of community and interactivity. 
  
 PASSWORD RESET
  User can reset his password. I used nodemailer to send email for the reset password.
 
 Google maps
  The application is using google map for location of a campground.
  
ADD, REMOVE AND UPDATE COMMENTS
As said above, you can add comments to campgrounds to express all kinds of things,
