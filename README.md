# Features:
  ADD, REMOVE, UPDATE CAMPGROUND
    The ultimate goal of the app is to add campgrounds, be they real or fictitious, Iâ€™m not much of a camper myself so I usually add fictional ones like for example, I made a campground called Lake Hylia Lodge, which is a reference to the Zelda series, however if you want to add real campground information feel free to, I actually implore anyone that visits the site to put up one of their favorite camping sports.

  User Authentication
    You can sign up, sign in, and its a necessary process to go through if you want to contribute to the site, why? because when a user is signed in it allows them to add campgrounds and comments, to really add a sense of community and interactivity. 

   PASSWORD RESET
    User can reset his password. I used nodemailer to send email for the reset password.

   Google maps
    The application is using google map for location of a campground.

  ADD, REMOVE AND UPDATE COMMENTS
  As said above, you can add comments to campgrounds to express all kinds of things,
